# Password Hashing Demo

1. This code demonstrates how the SHA1 and SHA256 hashing methods work.  The top section enables users to select the algorithm to see its effect.
2. The middle section demonstrates how salting a password works, with SHA256.
3. The bottom section demonstrates how bcrypt works with user-selectable salt rounds.  You can see how the hash from the bcrypt library differs from SHA256.
